                    <h2>FROM <span class="highlight">STRUGGLE</span> TO <span class="highlight">STRENGTH</span></h2>
                    <p>Like many of you, my fitness journey wasn't a straight line. Five years ago, I was overworked, stressed, and completely disconnected from my physical health. Working 60+ hours a week in a demanding corporate job left me with no energy, poor eating habits, and a body I didn't recognize.</p>
                    
                    <p>The wake-up call came after a routine health check revealed I was on a dangerous path ‚Äì high blood pressure, climbing cholesterol, and 40 pounds of excess weight. That moment changed everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>I didn't transform overnight. It took consistent, intentional action ‚Äì small steps that built momentum. I started with just 20-minute workouts, gradually improved my nutrition, and focused on sustainable habits rather than quick fixes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Two years later, not only had I transformed physically, but my entire mindset had shifted. I discovered that physical strength builds mental resilience, and that consistent action in the gym translates to confidence in every area of life.</p>
                    
                    <p>This journey led me to my true calling: helping others discover their strongest selves through the power of consistent, strategic fitness.</p>
