    "nutrition_tips": {
      "general": [
        "A simple nutrition approach: eat lean protein at every meal, fill half your plate with vegetables, add a quarter plate of complex carbs, and include healthy fats.",
        "Meal timing matters less than total daily intake for most people. Focus on hitting your protein targets and maintaining a consistent calorie intake based on your goals.",
        "Hydration affects performance significantly. Aim to drink half your bodyweight (in pounds) in ounces of water daily, and more on training days."
      ],
      "weight_loss": [
        "For sustainable fat loss, aim for a moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories below maintenance), prioritize protein (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight), and keep training intensity high.",
        "Consider nutrient timing for fat loss: consume more of your carbohydrates around your training sessions, and focus on protein and vegetables at other meals.",
        "Volume eating can help with fat loss - focus on high-volume, low-calorie foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and high-fiber carbs to stay fuller longer on fewer calories."
      ],
      "muscle_gain": [
        "To build muscle effectively, aim for a slight caloric surplus (200-300 calories above maintenance), high protein intake (1.8-2.2g per kg bodyweight), and adequate carbohydrates to fuel intense training.",
        "Don't fear carbs when building muscle. They're your primary fuel source for high-intensity training and help with recovery. Time them around your workouts for best results.",
        "Protein distribution matters for muscle growth. Aim for 4-5 meals with at least 25-30g of quality protein evenly spaced throughout the day."
      ],
      "pre_workout": [
        "For optimal performance, consume a pre-workout meal 1-2 hours before training: combine carbs for energy (fruit, oats, rice) with a moderate amount of protein. Keep fat and fiber lower to prevent digestive issues.",
        "Quick pre-workout snack options: banana with a tablespoon of nut butter, rice cakes with jam, or a small protein shake with fruit.",
        "If training fasted, consider BCAAs or a small protein shake to minimize muscle protein breakdown during training."
      ],
      "post_workout": [
        "The post-workout anabolic window isn't as narrow as once thought, but aim to consume 20-30g of protein and carbohydrates within 1-2 hours after training for optimal recovery.",
        "Great post-workout meals include: chicken with rice and vegetables, protein shake with a banana, or Greek yogurt with berries and granola.",
        "Don't neglect post-workout hydration and electrolytes, especially after intense or sweaty sessions. Water with a pinch of salt works well."
