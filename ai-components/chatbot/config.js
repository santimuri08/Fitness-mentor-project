    "workout_plan": "I offer personalized workout plans based on your goals, equipment access, and time availability. Would you like me to create a custom plan for you?",
    
    "nutrition": "Nutrition is a crucial component of fitness success. I recommend a balanced approach focusing on protein intake, adequate hydration, and whole foods. Would you like specific nutrition guidance?",
    
    "weight_loss": "Sustainable weight loss combines consistent exercise, caloric deficit, and patience. The key is finding activities you enjoy and a nutrition plan you can maintain long-term. Would you like more specific advice for your situation?",
    
    "muscle_gain": "Building muscle requires resistance training, caloric surplus, adequate protein (1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight), and proper recovery. Would you like a muscle-building program recommendation?",
    
    "beginner": "Welcome to your fitness journey! Start with 2-3 workouts per week focusing on full-body movements. Consistency is more important than intensity. Would you like a beginner-friendly program?",

    "injury": "I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for injury-specific advice. Once cleared, we can develop a modified plan that works around your limitations while promoting recovery.",
